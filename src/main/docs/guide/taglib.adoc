The TagLib https://github.com/basecamp/trix#integrating-with-forms[integrates Trix with forms] as described in their documentation:

[source,groovy]
./grails-app/taglib/demo/TrixTagLib.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/taglib/demo/TrixTagLib.groovy[indent=0]

<1> We use a http://docs.grails.org/2.2.1/guide/single.html#namespaces[custom name space]; _trix_
<2> By default we encode as _Text_ but the value, if present, is encoded as _Html_

And we test the _TagLib_:

[source,groovy]
./src/test/groovy/demo/TrixTagLibSpec.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/test/groovy/demo/TrixTagLibSpec.groovy[indent=0]

<1> `applyTemplate` gets as an argument anything that would be valid in a GSP. That code gets evaluated as if it were in a GSP and what's get returned is the result of evaluating that.
<2> Because this test is annotated with `@TestFor(TrixTagLib)` the compiler will add a property called `tagLib`. You can interact with that `tagLib` property and  invoke `editor` tag as it were a method.
You could pass a map which will be passed to the `args` or a closure as the last method parameter which will be used as the `body` of the tag.
